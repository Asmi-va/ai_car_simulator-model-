# Deep Q Learning

This repository contains an implementation of Deep Q Learning using PyTorch. The code includes a neural network for approximating Q-values, experience replay for training stability, and mechanisms for saving and loading model checkpoints.

## Overview

### Components

1. **Neural Network (`Network`)**
   - A simple feedforward neural network with one hidden layer.
   - Input layer to hidden layer: 30 neurons.
   - Hidden layer to output layer: Number of actions.

2. **Experience Replay (`ExperienceReplay`)**
   - Stores and manages past experiences to improve training stability.
   - Allows sampling of random batches of experiences for training.

3. **Deep Q Learning (`DeepQNetwork`)**
   - Manages training and decision-making processes.
   - Utilizes the neural network and experience replay to learn optimal policies.
   - Includes methods for action selection, learning from experiences, and model saving/loading.

## Installation

Ensure you have the required libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy torch
```

## Usage

1. **Initialize the Deep Q Network:**

   ```python
   dqn = DeepQNetwork(input_size=4, number_of_actions=2, gamma=0.99)
   ```

   - `input_size`: Number of features in the state.
   - `number_of_actions`: Number of possible actions.
   - `gamma`: Discount factor for future rewards.

2. **Updating the Model:**

   - Call `update(reward, new_signal)` after each step to update the model with new experiences.

   ```python
   action = dqn.update(reward=1.0, new_signal=[1, 0, 0, 1])
   ```

3. **Saving and Loading Models:**

   - To save the model:

     ```python
     dqn.save()
     ```

   - To load a saved model:

     ```python
     dqn.load()
     ```

4. **Scoring the Model:**

   - To get the average score:

     ```python
     average_score = dqn.score()
     ```

## Code Overview

- **`Network` Class:** Defines the neural network architecture.
- **`ExperienceReplay` Class:** Manages the replay buffer.
- **`DeepQNetwork` Class:** Implements Deep Q Learning algorithm with methods for action selection, learning, and model management.

### Example Code

Here's a snippet showing how to use the `DeepQNetwork` class:

```python
import torch

# Initialize DeepQNetwork
dqn = DeepQNetwork(input_size=4, number_of_actions=2, gamma=0.99)

# Simulate an experience
reward = 1.0
new_signal = [1, 0, 0, 1]

# Update the model
action = dqn.update(reward=reward, new_signal=new_signal)

# Save the model
dqn.save()

# Load the model
dqn.load()

# Get the average score
average_score = dqn.score()
print(f"Average Score: {average_score}")
```
